         <h2>About Us</h2>
         <p class="indent">Since the creation of PC's, many individuals lacked the knowledge of operating and troubleshooting these amazing machines. So, in response, one person started the company we call PC Support Pros today. The founder, Paul Huik, had one vision in mind throughout his college days and that vision in particular was
            of creating a business that would provide excellent customer service within the IT field. Huik only just started as a personal business located in his own dorm room with just a basic PC setup and a headset
            to communicate with any potential clients. Huik loved every aspect of communicating with his clients to help them with their daily computing issues. Throughout his college years, he stuck with his small business in hopes that it will grow into something spectacular.
            Upon graduating and receiving a degree in both Information Systems and Business Management, he set forth into finally structuring his business into something very much bigger. Within two years of his graduation the
            business has been thriving ever since with hundreds of employees that are at the ready to assist its clients in any type of PC issues.
